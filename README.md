# Design-and-fabrication-of-PMOS-Transistor

- PMOS integrated circuit on a silicon wafer was designed and the layout was fabricated in the clean lab.
- The PMOS layout schematic was done on the Athena Software.
- Design size : W/L = 60/10 ( all in Âµm )
- Every week the process was carried out step by step in the RIT cleanroom followed by testing of the IC and obtaining characteristic results for the device designed.
- In the end, the electrical characteristic was done, and measure the output waveform. 

#### Software Used: Athena
#### Lab : RIT clean room
#### Time Frame: Dec 2018
#### Course :  Micro Electronic Fabrication ( EE601 )
